                    <p class="paragraph">The giant panda has a body shape typical of bears. It has black fur on its
                        ears, eye patches, muzzle,
                        legs, arms and shoulders. The rest of the animal's coat is white. Although scientists do not
                        know
                        why these unusual bears are black and white, speculation suggests that the bold colouring
                        provides
                        effective camouflage in their shade-dappled snowy and rocky habitat</p>

                    <p class="paragraph">The polar bear (Ursus maritimus) is a hypercarnivorous bear whose native range
                        lies largely within
                        the Arctic Circle, encompassing the Arctic Ocean, its surrounding seas and surrounding land
                        masses.
                        It is a large bear, approximately the same size as the omnivorous Kodiak bear (Ursus arctos
                        middendorffi).A boar (adult male) weighs around 350–700 kg (772–1,543 lb)</p>

                    <p class="paragraph">The brown bear (Ursus arctos) is a bear species that is found across much of
                        northern Eurasia and
                        North America. In North America, the populations of brown bears are often called "grizzly
                        bears". It is one of the largest living terrestrial members of the order Carnivora, rivalled in
                        size
                        only by its closest relative, the polar bear (Ursus maritimus), which is much less variable in
                        size
                        and slightly larger on average.</p>
